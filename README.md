A tool to protect PII data in a file.


![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen) 

Its a end to end solution for protecting PII data with a single click with a user-friendly interface.

## Problem Statement:
Every year, billions of dollars are lost due to identity theft and fraud. Traditional systems for storing and managing sensitive personal data are vulnerable to hacking and data breaches, resulting in significant financial losses and a lack of trust in data security. Individuals have limited control over their personal information, and current methods often fail to protect privacy while enabling secure data sharing.

## Solution:
Our solution is designed to address these challenges by providing an easy-to-use platform that allows individuals to securely store and manage their personal data. The system uses advanced encryption techniques to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of stored data, making it virtually impossible for unauthorized parties to access or manipulate the information. Additionally, users can easily grant permissions to trusted entities such as banks, healthcare providers, and government agencies without compromising their privacy.
